# Instructions for visitors

Dear Visitor,
This project belongs to my friend Stefan and Me. 
It's still not finished.
I know that this github project is messy, but we don't have any experience in Github so, I started learning Github Branching https://learngitbranching.js.org/ and I will make it clean and organized as I am learning :). On this project I did 100% of app.py file and I did jinja code in html templates.
The last commit of our whole project is in "Whole" branch.

Best regards,
Aleksandar Cvetkovic
