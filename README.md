# Instructions for visitors

Dear Visitor,
This project belongs to my friend Stefan and Me. 
We did it for our exam on Academy for the subject named Web Development. It's still not finished.
I know that this github project is messy, but we don't have any experience in Github so, I started learning Github Branching https://learngitbranching.js.org/ and I will make it clean and organized as I am learning :). On this project I did 100% of app.py file and I did jinja code in html templates.
The last commit of our whole project is in "Whole" branch.
If you have any questions, be free to contact me on my e-mail address or linkedin.

Best regards,
Aleksandar Cvetkovic
